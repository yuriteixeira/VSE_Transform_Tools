# Blender Video Strip Crop

**WARNING**: ⚠️ WIP (just got started). Patience friends, patience. 👷 🏗️

## A blender add-on to allow croping video clips (strips) using the common "crop tool" paradigm

Based on the most up-to-date fork of [VSE_Transform_Tools](https://github.com/adhihargo/VSE_Transform_Tools), we're gonna **solely focus on the crop tool** here, since Blender 3.x now comes bundled with Video Strip transformations provided by the original add-on like Grab, Scale, Rotate - and other goodies that were out of this scope.

## Installing

1. [Go to the latest release](https://github.com/yuriteixeira/blender-vsc/releases) & download the `blender-vsc.zip` file
2. Insider Blender, go to `Preferences > Add-ons (sidebar) > Install`, importing the zip file you just downloaded, making it appear listed in the `Add-ons` section. **Enable it by clicking in it's checkbox**

**That's it!** You should see a "blade" icon now in the Preview whenever you start a Blender project in Video Editing mode
